The cost of mental health problems in developed countries is estimated to be between 3% and\\n4% of GNP . However, mental disorders cost national economies several billion dollars, both in terms of expenditures\\nincurred and loss of productivity. The average annual costs, including medical, pharmaceutical and disability costs, for\\nemployees with depression may be 4.2 times higher than those incurred by a typical beneﬁciary. However, the cost of\\ntreatment is often completely offset by a reduction in the number of days of absenteeism and productivity lost while \\nat work.\\nAlleviating the problem: prevention, promotion and management programmes\\nA combination of well-targeted treatment and prevention programmes in the ﬁeld of mental health, within overall pub-\\nlic strategies, could avoid years lived with disability and deaths, reduce the stigma attached to mental disorders, increase\\nconsiderably the social capital, help reduce poverty and promote a country’s development. \\nStudies provide examples of effective programmes targeted at different age groups – from prenatal and early infancy\\nprogrammes, through adolescence to old age – and different situations, such as post-traumatic stress following acci-\\ndents, marital stress, work-related stress, and depression or anxiety due to job loss, widowhood or adjustment to retire-\\nment. Many more studies need to be conducted in this area, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. There is\\nstrong evidence to show that successful interventions for schizophrenia, depression and other mental disorders are not\\nonly available, but are also affordable and cost-effective.\\nYet there is an enormous gap between the need for treatment of mental disorders and the resources available. In devel-\\noped countries with well organized health care systems, between 44% and 70% of patients with mental disorders do\\nnot receive treatment. In developing countries the ﬁgures are even more startling, with the treatment gap being close \\nto 90%.'),\n",

It is a condensed, easy-reference handbook providing \\nan outline of core concepts and basic interventions in mental health \\ncare.  The guide is not a substitute for comprehensive psychiatric, \\npsycho-social, or other related mental health texts or training and it \\nis imperative that practitioners or health care workers are responsi-\\nble in the interpretation and application of information.  In addi-\\ntion, differences in cultural beliefs and practices will influence the \\nmanner and extent to which the guide is used by individuals in \\nvaried regions.   \\nPresented in this guidebook is an allopathic (western) approach to \\nidentifying and managing various mental health conditions.  The \\nallopathic medical system represents only one method for dealing \\nwith mental health issues and other systems of care may have a \\ndifferent relevance or applicability  in varied parts of the world. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

In addition, educators can \\nuse different aspects of the manual as a source of material for dif-\\nferent types and levels of training activity. \\nAll chapters will provide readers with a basic understanding of key \\ntopics in the field of mental health.  Descriptions of conditions and \\nimportant issues within the mental health field are written using \\nterminology that can be appreciated by both the professional and \\nthe lay person. \\nThe “Medication Guide” section may be especially useful to allo-\\npathic physicians and other clinicians such as physician assistants, \\nnurse practitioners, and medical officers (who have the authority to \\nprescribe medication under the supervision of a physician in some \\ncountries).

Neuropsychiatric disorders con-\\ntribute to approximately 13% of the global burden of disease and \\ncreate (to varying degrees among countries) burden in every coun-\\ntry in the world. \\nAssessments of mental health resources worldwide are done with \\nthe aim of shedding light on the most recent global view of re-\\nsources available to prevent neuropsychiatric disorders, provide \\nintervention, and protect human rights.  WHO reports of mental \\nhealth worldwide have examined resources with regard to geo-\\ngraphic region and economic status.  Categorizing countries into \\nregions is one way to organize the huge volume of information \\nabout mental health structures and services throughout the world.  \\nIn addition, looking at regions may be useful from an economic \\nperspective.  It has been established that many nations have no or \\nvery limited mental health programming and need to utilize the \\nsupport of other countries to develop a system of care.  Being in a \\nregion where a high percentage of neighboring countries have re-\\nsources can be useful for a country in the same area that has limita-\\ntions.  In addition, using the resources of a nation nearby may be \\nless expensive and a faster process than relying on resources from a \\nfar distance. \\n '),\n",

This information can po-\\ntentially guide the planning of mental health policies, legislation, \\nprograms and services.  The information may also be useful to \\nfunding agencies providing financial support to countries that \\nwant to develop resources.   \\n \\nLimitations of Global Studies & Reports \\nTrying to understand the status of mental health care in countries \\nthroughout the world has been a challenging process.  Existing \\nreports and studies have taken the best measures possible to be \\nscientific and accurate in collecting, analyzing, and placing in \\nperspective results of data.  Nevertheless, these studies are not \\nwithout their limitations.  \\n With regard to a discussion of mental health care by global re-\\ngion, data may be limited by the way regions have been catego-\\nrized.  In a report on global mental health (WHO, 2005) \\n“regions” are not necessarily divided precisely or purely by \\nglobal or physical location (i.e. a “region” may include countries \\nthat are not physically located on the same continent).  In some \\ncases, the “regional” similarity appears to be related to historical, \\ncultural, or economic factors that may link and make a group of \\ncountries comparable for analysis.  \\nOther limitations include an inability to obtain information from \\nall countries on all variables, variations in how different countries \\ndefine mental health concepts, and variations from country to \\ncountry in sources of information.

Data \\nfrom the WHO is particularly highlighted. One reviewing this \\ninformation should continue to follow subsequent studies, re-\\nports, and related literature from varied sources to gain a full and \\naccurate perspective of global mental health care. \\n \\nRecent Data \\nResults of a recent assessment of 184 of 196 World Health Or-\\nganization (WHO) member states  (representing 95% of WHO \\nmember states and 98% of the world’s population) have indicated \\nthat there is a growing burden of neuropsychiatric disease and \\nthat mental health resources remain insufficient (WHO 2011).  \\nThe burden of disease is much greater in low income countries \\ncompared to high income countries.   However, the number of \\nbeds in mental hospitals is reduced in the majority of countries \\nwhich may be an indication of a shift from institutional care to \\ncommunity-based care.  \\nIn the WHO 2011 report, geographic regions were classified as \\nAfrica (AFR), the Americas (AMR), Eastern Mediterranean \\n(EMR), Europe (EUR), South/South-East Asia (SEAR), and the \\nWestern Pacific (WPR) and income levels were described in \\nterms of high (gross national per capita income of US$ 12, 276 or \\nmore), upper-middle (US$ 12,275 – $3,976), lower-middle (US$ \\n3975 - $1006), and low (US$ 1005 or less).

Mental Health Capacity Building \\n27 \\nGUIDELINES FOR TEACHING PRIMARY HEALTHCARE \\nSTAFF TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE  \\nOne approach to training primary healthcare staff to provide men-\\ntal health care involves a) establishing learning goals and objec-\\ntives that are relevant and applicable to the existing practices of the \\nprimary care staff; b) developing theoretical mental health presen-\\ntations and practical on-the-job supervision sessions that are effec-\\ntive and convenient; and c) utilizing comprehensive evaluations to \\nmonitor and further enhance learning.  It is important that those \\nteaching have the appropriate level of education or experience in \\ntheir areas of instruction and that trainees have a basic level of \\nunderstanding that will allow them to comprehend the instruction.    \\n \\nA) Establishing Learning Goals & Objectives – What is the infor-\\nmation trainees are expected to learn? \\nObjectives may be defined as the learning needed to reach a par-\\nticular goal. Trainers must decide on the desired goal of their train-\\ning sessions and then develop clear objectives that will lead to the \\ngoal. \\nGoals and objectives need to be relevant or directly applicable to \\nthe real situations staff face in their primary care settings. \\nExample: A goal of a mental health training course for a group of \\nprimary care doctors may be that they learn to provide an effective \\ntreatment for an individual with a particular mental health condi-\\ntion.  Objectives toward this goal may include their a) learning to \\ntake a psychiatric history; b) learning the varied signs and symp-\\ntoms of varied mental health conditions; and c) learning the varied \\ntypes of therapies to manage conditions.  A number of objectives \\nmay be involved in achieving an overall goal.   \\n  '),\n",

A lec-\\nture format that is interactive (i.e. involves audience participation) \\nand offers a clear outline can be effective.  However, lengthy or \\nnumerous lectures should be minimized for primary care staff who \\nmay be overwhelmed already with several tasks and responsibili-\\nties.

MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS & ISSUES:   \\nIdentification and Interventions \\n \\nOVERVIEW \\n \\nThe allopathic (western) medical system represents one approach \\nto dealing with mental health issues and managing mental health \\nconditions.  Allopathic mental health care  may be described as a \\nsystem of care in which staff has been trained in medical science, \\nbehavioral science, formal psychotherapy and provides services in \\ninpatient hospitals, outpatient clinics, and other community facili-\\nties.  This system of care is one form of support that is used today, \\ncommonly in high-income societies.  Non-allopathic types of care \\nmay include traditional, indigenous, complementary, alternative, \\ninformal, and local medicine and in some countries are utilized as \\na primary or complementary means of care. These systems may \\ninvolve the use of animal or mineral based medicines, religious or \\nspiritual interventions, and manual techniques, either singularly or \\nin combination.   \\n \\nPresented in this part of the guidebook is an allopathic approach to \\nmanaging various mental health conditions.  Basic theoretical con-\\ncepts, counseling interventions, and medication therapies are de-\\nscribed. '),\n",

Relapse is \\npossible and should be anticipated.  Review with them the signs \\nand symptoms of bipolar disorder.  Emphasize the importance of \\nmedication compliance. \\n2. Emphasize medication compliance.  Discuss with the doctor \\nmedication options and regimens that will make taking pills easy \\n(e.g. use of pill organizer boxes; explore whether once a day \\ndosing is appropriate and possible). \\n3. Reward constructive actions.  Determine the items or situa-\\ntions that the patient values and reward him/her with them when \\nappropriate behavior is displayed (e.g. offer a valued reward for \\nhaving contained impulsive  behaviors). \\n4. Encourage a routine schedule. Outline a weekly schedule with \\nthe individual.  A structured routine helps one to know what to \\ndo and expect  and helps to reduce the stress and anxiety that can \\nprecipitate symptoms.  \\n5. Help the individual identify situations that cause stress or \\nanxiety as these can be triggers for a relapse of illness.  Help the \\nindividual limit involvement in these situations.  If a stressful \\nsituation is unavoidable, help the patient think in advance about \\nwhat may occur and how he/she will respond.  Breathing and \\nrelaxation exercises can reduce anxiety felt in these situations \\n(see chapter on “Anxiety Conditions” for breathing and relaxa-\\ntion exercises). \\n6. Emphasize keeping track of appointments.  Missed appoint-\\nments can lead to the individual’s running out of medication.  \\nMissing doses of medicine can put the individual at risk for a \\nreturn of symptoms and a relapse of illness.  \\n '),\n",

Types of neurocognitive disorders include: 1)  \\ndelirium and 2) major & mild neurocognitive disorders \\n(dementia). \\n1) Delirium \\nDelirium is a disturbance particularly in the ability to focus, \\nsustain, or shift attention.  Other characteristics of delirium \\nmay include additional deficits in cognition (e.g. memory, \\nperception), rapid onset, a fluctuating course, reversiblility, \\nagitation, irritability, and psychosis (i.e. distortion of reality).  \\nCauses of delirium may include brain disease, systemic dis-\\nease (e.g. heart disease), drugs, medications, and other tox-\\nins. \\nNeuropsychiatric symptoms of delirium may be identified \\nthrough a thorough mental status examination.

In general, a pervasive \\ncognitive and intellectual decline with a lack of impaired \\nawareness or consciousness is what distinguishes demen-\\ntia from delirium.

Children need clear, honest, consistent explana-\\ntions appropriate to their level of development.  They need \\nto accept the reality of the loss not to be protected from it.  \\nMagical thinking should be explored and corrected.  What \\nis imagined may be worse than reality and children may be \\nblaming themselves for events beyond their control.  En-\\ncourage a supportive environment where open communi-\\ncation is possible, difficult questions are answered, and \\ndistressing feelings are tolerated.  Allow children to ex-\\npress grief in a manner they find appropriate, to express to \\nthe people they most trust and feel comfortable, and to \\nexpress at a time of their choosing. \\n \\nIf a child has lost a parent or significant caretakers, the \\nchild will need to be provided consistent, enduring, appro-\\npriate care.  The more continuity with the child’s previous \\nlife, the better.  Children may wish to avoid traumatic re-\\nminders, especially in the beginning, but complete removal \\nfrom a familiar environment may cause more pain and \\nproblems in the long term.  They should be reunited with \\ncaring extended family if available. \\n \\n '),\n",

Personal, social, academic, and occupational functioning \\nmay be limited with some disorders manifesting with deficits and \\ndelays in reaching normal developmental milestones.

In this chapter, \\nspecific conditions that are emphasized include intellectual devel-\\nopmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and \\nTourette’s disorder (motor disorder). \\n \\nA) Intellectual Disability (intellectual developmental disorder) \\nIntellectual disability, or intellectual developmental disorder, is a \\ncondition of disabled mental abilities, such as reasoning, problem \\nsolving, planning, abstract thinking, judgment, academic learning, \\nand learning from experience.

Prenatal causes of intellectual disability \\ninclude genetic syndromes, inborn errors of metabolism, brain \\nmalformations, maternal disease, and environmental influences. \\nPerinatal and postnatal causes have included complications during \\nlabor and delivery, oxygen deprivation, traumatic brain injury, \\ninfections, demyelinating disorders, seizure disorders, severe and \\nchronic social deprivation, and toxic metabolic syndromes and \\nintoxications.  A diagnosis of intellectual disability requires that an \\nindividual has impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning rela-\\ntive to the individual’s age, gender, and socio-culturally matched \\npeers. The onset of these deficits is during the developmental pe-\\nriod before adulthood. Treatments for intellectual disability include \\nearly behavioral intervention, special education, specialized ser-\\nvices, adaptive skill training, and transition planning.  \\n \\nB) Autism Spectrum Disorder \\nAutism spectrum disorder is a condition of impaired social com-\\nmunication and social interaction and the presence of restricted, \\nrepetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. Across US \\nand non-US countries, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder \\nis approximately 1% of the population. Many factors may place a \\nchild at risk for autism spectrum disorder, such as advanced paren-\\ntal age, low birth weight, premature birth, or fetal exposure to val-\\nproic acid. Twin concordance studies have indicated heritability \\nestimates ranging from 37% to 90% . Various genetic mutations \\nhave also been suggested as a contributing factor in some cases.  A \\ndiagnosis of  autism spectrum disorder is considered with the oc-\\ncurrence of continual deficits in reciprocal social communication \\nand interaction and patterns of behavior, interests, or activities that \\nare significantly  restricted or repetitive. Symptoms begin during \\nearly childhood and hinder daily functioning. Effective treatments \\nfor autism spectrum disorder are early intervention services includ-\\ning applied behavioral analysis.

Sources have \\nindicated that low birth weight, premature delivery, smoking and \\nalcohol use during pregnancy, exposure to environment toxicants, \\nand brain injury are factors that have been variably correlated with \\nADHD, but are not known to be causal.  ADHD heritability rates \\nare rather high and specific genes have been correlated with the \\ndisorder.  \\n \\nSigns/Characteristics \\nSymptoms may exist as inattention singly or as hyperactivity/\\nimpulsivity, or a combination of inattention + hyperactivity/\\nimpulsivity.  Symptoms of ADHD usually become apparent in \\nprimary school or other environments that are structured settings \\ndemanding task completion.  In the school setting, teachers’ obser-\\nvations are important.  Teachers are in a position to compare pat-\\nterns of compliance, on-task behavior, capacity for fundamental \\nlearning tasks (e.g. reading, spelling, arithmetic) and disruptive-\\nness with other children pursuing similar tasks.  A diagnosis of \\nADHD requires a continuous pattern of inattention and/or hyperac-\\ntivity-impulsivity that negatively affects an individual’s function-\\ning or development.  '),\n",

Emotional and Behavioral Problems \\n \\nA) Depression and anxiety \\nDepression and some anxiety disorders are common in the adult popu-\\nlation but occur with notable frequency in children as well.  Depres-\\nsion and anxiety may coexist and, as with other conditions, may be \\nexpressed differently from one individual to the next.  These condi-\\ntions may be expressed in behavior or other nonverbal expressions, \\nsince children are at an early stage in their emotional maturity.  A \\ndepressed child may appear sad, angry or agitated and may isolate \\nfrom others.  Children with anxiety, depression or a combination of \\nboth may also experience sleep problems or exhibit poor performance \\nin school. \\nManagement of depression or anxiety in children involves providing \\nsupport for the child and education for the family.  Antidepressant \\nmedications are not recommended for children (some medicines have \\nbeen shown to increase distress and ideas of suicide) and many short-\\nterm anti-anxiety medicines have potential for addiction.  Help the \\nchild and family identify the actions that may represent the distress \\nand help them to identify the circumstances in which these actions \\noccur.  Even though a child’s emotions are developing he or she can \\nstill be taught basic ways to verbalize distress.  Using simple cultur-\\nally appropriate picture charts showing different emotions and situa-\\ntions with which the child can identify, can be a way to begin discus-\\nsions about feelings.  Encourage the verbalization of distress.   Ver-\\nbalization can improve another’s (family, schoolmates, teachers) abil-\\nity to understand the child’s problem and provide a more effective \\nresponse.  Help the child recognize and understand that negative feel-\\nings such as anger and disappointment are natural human emotions \\nand that there are constructive ways to manage these emotions (i.e. \\nhelp the child to identify and anticipate difficult situations and teach \\nthe child a variety of healthy responses to the situations). \\n \\n '),\n",

For example, a depressed parent may \\nnot have the energy or motivation to attend to the child’s basic \\nemotional needs.  This can turn into psychological distress and \\nemotional problems for the child. \\n \\nB) Elimination Disorders \\n \\nEnuresis (bed-wetting) \\nEnuresis may be defined as the inability of the child to control his \\nbladder (after 5 years of age).  The condition is not related to a \\nsecondary cause (such as a medical problem or ingestion of diu-\\nretic agents) but is psychological in nature.  Enuresis may occur \\nduring sleep or while awake. Enuresis causes a lot of stress and \\nshame for the child and can lead to more serious problem if not \\ntreated early.  A thorough psychiatric history, mental status exami-\\nnation with emphasis on the developmental history, medical his-\\ntory, and social environment is important. \\n \\nManagement of Enuresis \\nA medical evaluation should be done to eliminate underlying \\nmedical causes for the problem. Be sure to assess for environ-\\nmental conditions  (e.g. if the wetting occurs during school time, is \\nit due to dirty toilets, or unavailable toilets at school?).  Also assess \\nfor other underlying psychological distress (e.g. the child who wets \\nthe bed may experience nightmares or night terrors and may be too \\nafraid to go to the toilet). '),\n",

The acute \\nemergency phase has been defined as the period where crude \\nmortality rate is increased due to circumstances or an environ-\\nment in which basic needs (i.e. food, shelter, security, water/\\nsanitation, disease control, and access to health care) are di-\\nminished.   \\n \\nDuring the emergency phase the focus is primarily on social \\ninterventions such as restoration of basic needs (i.e. food, shel-\\nter, security, water/sanitation, disease control, and access to \\nhealth care).  Psychological and psychiatric interventions dur-\\ning this phase are aimed at acute situations: the relief of acute \\ndistress through psychological first aid (see the next page); \\nevaluation and treatment of severe conditions including suici-\\ndal intentions, psychosis, mania, severe depression, and epi-\\nlepsy; and ensuring the availability of psychotropic medica-\\ntions for patients with pre-existing psychiatric conditions.  \\n '),\n",

Because of the serious nature and impact of GBV, the \\nsubject is addressed exclusively in this chapter.   \\nThe data on the prevalence and incidence of GBV in insecure set-\\ntings have limitations due to under-reporting of incidents.  Under-\\nreporting occurs for many reasons including fear of retaliation and \\nre-victimization, stigma, self blame, and mistrust of authorities.  \\nData available on GBV have indicated, a female victim and male \\nperpetrator are involved most frequently. While men and boys may \\nalso be vulnerable to sexual violence (particularly in situations of \\ntorture and detention ) the majority of survivors/victims of sexual \\nviolence have been females.   \\nBecause there is a tendency for under-reporting, it is important that \\nhealthcare staff working in unstable environments have an aware-\\nness and willingness to take constructive action when violence is \\nsuspected.  This chapter provides an outline of information on the \\nnature, causes, effects, and active interventions associated with \\ngender-based violence in insecure settings. \\n \\n '),\n",

Specific types of GBV may vary across countries, re-\\ngions, and cultures and may include: a) domestic violence; b) \\nforced/early marriage; c) harmful traditional practices (e.g. female \\ngenital mutilation, honor killings, widow inheritance); d) traffick-\\ning; and e) sexual violence. \\n \\nRegarding sexual violence, it may be described as an unwanted, \\ndestructive sexual advance that is executed (e.g. as a sexual action) \\nor implied (e.g. as sexual verbal expression).  Studies have indi-\\ncated that power and control underlie the perpetration as opposed \\nto an amorous attraction or desire.  Forms of sexual violence seen \\nin insecure settings have included: rape (most often cited); at-\\ntempted assaults; verbal sexual threats and humiliating comments; \\nmolestation or repeated unwanted advances; domestic violence \\ntoward a spouse; and incest toward a  family relative. \\n \\nReports have indicated that groups associated with GBV perpetra-\\ntion in insecure settings may include fellow refugees; other clan \\nmembers; religious or ethnic groups; military personnel; relief \\nworkers; and family members.  Regarding sexual violence, the \\nsurvivor often knows the perpetrator. '),\n",

A number of the medical diseases associated \\nwith HIV manifest as neurological or neuropsychiaric illnesses (e.g. neu-\\nropathy, central nervous system infections and tumors).  People infected by \\nthe virus may be burdened also by emotions such as fear, anger, and guilt, \\nwhich, if not placed in perspective, may contribute to more severe psychiat-\\nric conditions.  In addition, social consequences of HIV disease have in-\\ncluded stigma, loss of household income and financial stability, and the \\ndestruction of family and community structures. \\n \\nMental health support in general (e.g. psychoeducation; supportive group, \\nfamily, and individual counseling; and, in the case of severe illness, medi-\\ncation therapy) may play a role in influencing the overall health of indi-\\nviduals whose lives have been affected by the epidemic.  Special forms of \\ncounseling, such as HIV information/prevention counseling and adherence \\ncounseling, are associated with mental health and are important to decreas-\\ning the spread of infection and the proliferation of disease.   \\n \\n '),\n",

HIV \\ncan cause AIDS (or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) which is a \\ncollection of symptoms or medical conditions that indicate immune dys-\\nfunction. \\n \\nHIV can enter the body through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, and breast \\nmilk.  HIV is most often transmitted through sexual contact or the transfer \\nof contaminated blood (through blood transfusions or intravenous drug \\nabuse).  Infants can be infected in the uterus or through breast-feeding \\nwhen their mothers are infected with HIV.   \\n \\nData from several countries indicates that the acquisition and transmission \\nof HIV is reduced with abstinence from sexual activity, condom use, de-\\ncreased sharing of contaminated drug paraphernalia, screened blood prod-\\nucts used for transfusions, and the use of antiretroviral medication .  Educa-\\ntion and HIV testing are the means by which individuals can understand \\nand take action to prevent or manage disease. '),\n",

HIV targets \\nCD4+ T cells, disables their normal function, and facilitates a genetic \\nprocess that leads to proliferation of the virus.  CD4+ T cells can be meas-\\nured through analysis of a blood sample.  The US National  Institute of \\nAllergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has cited a normal CD4+ T cell \\ncount as 800-1200mm3 (other sources have cited a normal range = 500-\\n1500mm3).  A low CD4+ T cell count is an indication of impairment of an \\naspect of the immune system and raises suspicion for HIV disease. Experts \\nhave indicated that counts of less than 500mm3 usually mean damage to \\nthe immune system, counts less than 200mm3 mean severe damage, and \\ncounts less than 50mm3 mean damage of even greater severity.  When \\nantiretroviral medications are used CD4+ T cell counts improve. \\n \\nThe viral “load” is a measure of the amount of viral particles in a given \\nblood sample and may be an indication of one’s response to treatment and \\nprognosis.  The viral load found in blood has been found to accurately \\nreflect the total burden of HIV in the body.   '),\n",

Studies have \\nindicated that following primary infection, as many as 50-70% of infected \\nindividuals may develop an acute “flu-like” syndrome, also known as acute \\nretroviral syndrome (ARS).  This has been estimated to occur 3-6 weeks after \\ninfection and may last from 1-4 weeks.  Symptoms of ARS may include fever, \\nsweats, fatigue, joint pain, headache, sore throat and enlarged lymph nodes or \\nglands.  Some individuals may also experience a skin rash and neuropsychiat-\\nric symptoms such confusion, mood changes, and personality changes.  As the \\nimmune system mounts a response, the viral load declines and the CD4+ T \\ncell count rises and reconstitutes. As the immune response progresses, symp-\\ntoms of ARS decrease.  Most individuals will then enter a period of clinical \\nlatency where the virus is less active. \\n \\nB) Clinical Latency \\nDuring this phase, the virus is still present in the body, but is less active.  \\nMany individuals do not have any symptoms of HIV infection. The duration \\nof this period can vary greatly among individuals, but the median has been \\nestimated to be 10 years. \\n \\n '),\n",

With the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy \\n(HAART), HIV-1 infection has become a chronic, manageable disease for \\nindividuals with stable suppression of the virus and access to treatment. \\nHAART is the combination of several antiretroviral medicines used to slow \\nthe rate at which HIV multiplies in the body. A combination of three or more \\nantiretroviral medicines (often referred to as a “cocktail”) is more effective \\nthan using just one medicine (monotherapy) to treat the virus.  The current \\nrecommendation for starting HAART in the United States is to begin therapy \\nwhen the CD4+ T cell count falls to 500cells/ml or below. There are sources \\nthat have also indicated that, in mid– and low income countries, initiation of \\ntherapy is recommended for a CD4+ T cell count of 350cells/ml or below. \\nAnti-retroviral medications generally target or interfere with steps in the \\nreproductive cycle of the virus.

If there is anti-retroviral \\nmedication in the system but not at a level to effectively disable the virus, \\nthe virus can potentially mutate or change to a form that can resist the effects \\nof the medication.  This capacity to change and resist medication effects is \\ntermed resistance.  Resistance is an important reason why HIV drugs stop \\nworking.  Missed doses of medication or continuing on a drug regimen that \\nis not effective can encourage resistance.  Interactions with other medicines \\nthat reduce HIV medication in the system or a poor ability to absorb HIV \\nmedication into the bloodstream can also contribute to resistance.   \\n \\n \\nAdherence  \\n \\nThe risk of resistance may be reduced by maintaining adherence to the anti-\\nretroviral medicines prescribed.  Adherence, in simple terms, means the abil-\\nity to take medications as prescribed.  Specifically, adherence involves a) \\ntaking the appropriate anti-retroviral drugs; b) taking the drugs on the appro-\\npriate schedule; and c) taking the drugs in the correct manner (e.g. with or \\nwithout food).  One hundred percent adherence is required for treatment to \\nbe effective.  With precise adherence, antiretroviral therapy will be success-\\nful.  With poor adherence continued viral replication and increased viral load \\nmay occur, the CD4+ T cell count may decrease (increasing the risk for op-\\nportunistic infections), and the potential for resistance may emerge.  It can \\nbe challenging for individuals to maintain 100% adherence.  Adherence \\ncounselling provides those with difficulty support and techniques to improve \\nand maintain adherence.  Specific techniques are outlined in a subsequent \\nsection of this chapter. '),\n",

The infections may \\nbe caused by varied pathogens such as viruses (e.g. HIV, hepatitis) or bac-\\nteria (e.g. syphilis, gonorrhea).  STDs may increase a person’s risk for \\nbecoming infected with HIV by causing conditions that allow easier pas-\\nsage of the virus into the body (e.g. passage through open sores, ulcers, \\nand irritations).  The inflammatory process (resulting from damage by \\ncertain STDs to the skin surface) increases the presence and concentration \\nof immune cells to the area that can serve as targets for HIV (e.g. CD4+ \\ncells).  In addition, those infected with HIV, who contract subsequent \\nSTDs,  are at increased risk of transmitting the virus to sexual partners. \\nStudies indicate that those infected with HIV and also have other STDs \\ncan shed the virus in their genital secretions.  The higher the concentration \\nof HIV in genital fluids, the more likely the virus may be spread to a part-\\nner.   \\n      \\n \\nContracting an STD may have serious implications for one who is HIV-\\npositive. Some STDs are curable or eradicated with antibiotic treatment \\n(e.g. gonorrhea, syphilis).  However, others may not be eradicated fully \\nand may be associated with potentially fatal diseases such as cancer (HPV, \\nHep C) and liver failure (Hep B, Hep C).

De-\\nmentia may be caused by varied conditions such as degenerative brain dis-\\neases (e.g. Alzheimer’s Disease), vascular (blood vessel) disease, or chronic \\nalcohol or drug abuse. The onset of dementia is typically insidious or slow \\nlasting months to years.  Dementias that involve ongoing degeneration or de-\\nstruction of brain tissue are usually irreversible. \\n \\nHIV may directly damage brain tissue leading to a dementia-like syndrome.  \\nOver the years, several names have been attached to more severe and milder \\naspects of HIV-related dementia and have included AIDS dementia complex \\n(ADC), HIV associated dementia (HAD), HIV-encephalopathy, subacute en-\\ncephalitis, HIV cognitive/motor complex (HIV CMC), minor cognitive-motor \\ndisorder, and HIV associated neurocognitive disease (HAND).

Symptoms may be similar to those associated with other types of \\ndementia and include decreased short-term memory, decreased attention and \\nconcentration, disturbance in word finding, decelerated thought processing, \\npsychomotor retardation (i.e. slowed movement), impaired reasoning and in-\\ntellect, and, in advanced disease, impaired visual-spatial function (i.e. aspect \\nof brain function that analyzes and understands space in two and three dimen-\\nsions).  Personality changes and mood disturbances such as depression may \\noccur.  Less commonly, manic symptoms (agitation, irritability, impulsivity, \\nand excessive talkativeness) and psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, irra-\\ntional suspiciousness, or paranoia) may be present.  Motor deficits (i.e. im-\\npaired movement) are also a part of the HIV-related dementia syndrome and \\nmay include muscle weakness, increased or decreased muscle tone, spasticity \\nmovements, muscle rigidity or “cogwheeling,”  and over or under- reactive \\nreflexes. \\nA complete medical and psychiatric evaluation are important in evaluating an \\nindividual with HIV who presents with neurocognitive symptoms. Where \\navailable, laboratory tests (e.g. complete blood count, CD4 count, HIV viral \\nload, chemistry screen, urinalysis, blood/urine cultures, ECG, chest x-ray, and, \\nwhen applicable, drug toxicology screen, thyroid function tests, and B6 & B12 \\nvitamin levels) and neuroimaging (e.g. magnetic resonance imaging or MRI) \\nare used in the evaluation of HIV-related dementia.  \\nHIV-related dementia has been treatable.  That is, symptoms may be reduced \\nwith anti-retroviral therapy.  Specific psychiatric symptoms of the dementia \\nsyndrome may be addressed with particular treatments as well.  For example, \\nif agitation has developed and is severe, low dose antipsychotic may be used \\n(e.g. olanzapine or seroquel if available or chlorpromazine).  Low dose antip-\\nsychotics may be used if hallucinations are present as well.  Avoiding antipsy-\\nchotics causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) is generally recommended.   '),\n",

The client-centered HIV prevention counseling approach has been \\nshown to be both efficient and effective.  Client-centered counseling fo-\\ncuses on the client’s own unique situation and involves helping the client \\noutline and achieve an explicit behavior change goal to decrease the \\nchance of acquiring or transmitting HIV.  For individuals taking the stan-\\ndard HIV test, the client-centered approach involves two brief, in-person \\nor face-to-face sessions with a health provider or counselor.  In the first \\nsession, an assessment of the client’s personal HIV risk is made; a risk \\nbehavior (if any) and action to change that behavior is identified and dis-\\ncussed; the HIV test is performed; and the client is asked to return in 2 \\nweeks for results.  \\nIn the second session, progress made in changing the previously identified \\nrisk behavior is discussed, additional behavior change actions are outlined \\nas needed, HIV test results are provided and discussed, and referral to ad-\\nditional services is offered as indicated. \\nWith rapid testing, there may be either one or two sessions depending on \\ntest results. Individuals with preliminary positive rapid HIV test results  \\nwill have another session when they return for their confirmatory results.  \\nClients at risk for HIV but with negative rapid HIV test results receive one \\nsession of counseling that includes a risk-reduction plan.

Assess the client’s personal risk for HIV.  What in particular puts this indi-\\nvidual at risk for HIV?   Ask in a non-judgmental way and use active, attentive \\nlistening to determine whether the client engages in risk behaviors such as \\nunprotected sex with others who may be at risk for HIV; abuse of intravenous \\ndrugs or other mind-altering substances that could alter judgment or has had \\nblood transfusions or exposure to contaminated blood products.  Risk also \\ninvolves one’s maintaining misconceptions such as the belief that he or she \\ncould never be afflicted or that their culture or society could never understand \\nor accept using precautions against HIV.  It is important to help the client \\nidentify and understand these “risks” as well.  Discuss in a sensitive manner \\nthe circumstances that put them at risk. Remember that this is not the time to \\ndiscuss the meaning of test results (this is covered at another point in the coun-\\nseling process).  Also, the counselor should not engage in discussions of addi-\\ntional problems unrelated to the client’s specific HIV risk factors (discussing \\nother illnesses, social problems, etc…).  There will be another time in the \\ncounseling process to address these issues as well. \\n 2. Explore attempts already made to reduce risk behaviors.  If the client al-\\nready engaged in risk-reducing behavior, acknowledge his or her success. \\nAlso, encourage discussion of the challenges that made decreasing risk behav-\\nior difficult and discuss how these challenges were managed. \\n  \\n3. If there is an identifiable risk factor (e.g. unprotected sex) and action has not \\nbeen taken already to decrease the risky behavior, discuss a specific, concrete \\naction that can help reduce the risk (e.g. provide information on the proper use \\nof and how to obtain condoms and ask the client to use them between now and \\nthe time he returns for the HIV test results). \\n4. Describe, discuss, and answer questions regarding the HIV testing process. \\n '),\n",

Asking group \\nmembers to respect one another’s privacy is important (i.e. do not \\nshare members information with people not involved in the group).  \\nAlso, the leaders should emphasize that violence of any kind (e.g. \\nphysical assault or verbal attack) is not acceptable and grounds for \\ndismissal from the group. \\nThe participants should be encouraged to share the actual experi-\\nences that have caused distress, how these experiences have im-\\npacted their lives and function, and the emotions they have felt as a \\nresult.  The point of the group is to have members realize that they \\nare not alone and that it is human and natural to experience emo-\\ntions that can feel negative or painful.  The group discussions \\nshould also help people develop an awareness of their own \\nstrengths and serve as an environment where they are constantly \\nreminded of their strengths.   In addition, hearing about ways that \\nothers have coped can help individuals increase and enhance their \\nown methods of coping. \\nWhen individuals express strong emotions, such as anger, allow \\nthem to express openly. Their feelings should be acknowledged.  '),\n",

Ob-\\nservation (e.g. viewing for tremors, drooling, stooped posture, and \\na shuffling walking pattern) and physical examination ( e.g. flexing \\nthe elbow joints and feeling the arm muscles for tightness or rigid-\\nity) are ways to detect symptoms.  Studies (western research) indi-\\ncate that EPS is more common with high potency typical antipsy-\\nchotics (e.g. haloperidol and fluphenazine) than with low potency \\nantipsychotics (e.g. phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine).  High \\ndoses of antipsychotic medication are associated with an increased \\nrisk for EPS.  Western studies (United States) have found that \\nsymptoms are more common in men under the age of 35 who have \\nmuscular body types.  EPS typically occur within the first 4 weeks \\nof antipsychotic use and are reversible with  discontinuation of the \\ndrug.  Symptoms may disappear within days to months after antip-\\nsychotic medication has been stopped. If a patient needs to remain \\non medication to control severe psychotic symptoms, EPS may be \\nreduced with anticholinergic medicines such as trihexyphenidyl or \\ndiphenhydramine and, for akathisia specifically, propanolol and \\nbenzodiazepines (i.e. diazepam, lorazepam, and clonazepam).  \\n \\n \\n '),\n",

Use of the benzodiazepines in short-term \\nis usually recommended.   \\nb) For chronic anxiety conditions (e.g. panic disorder, obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress, \\nsocial anxiety disorder) other agents such as SSRIs (selective serotonin \\nreuptake inhibitors – e.g. fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, citalopram, \\nescitalpram), SNRIs (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors – e.g. \\nduloxetine, venlafaxine), buspirone, and tricyclics (clomipramine) have \\nbeen effective.  \\nNOTES FOR MEDICATIONS IN THIS SECTION: \\n 1) Only common side effects are noted.  Prescribers should check the medication literature for all potential side effects and \\ndrug interactions.  2) Children, the elderly, adults with small body composition, and individuals with medical illness or \\nnutritional deficiencies may require smaller initial & maintenance doses for effect and may be more susceptible to side \\neffects.  3) Studies in the United States have indicated that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and \\nbehavior in children, adolescents, and young adults age 18-24 with major depressive disorder (DSM IV criteria).  A number \\nof agents are not approved in the United States for use in the pediatric population.  4) For an explanation of the abbrevia-\\ntions included in the tables, see the “Medical Abbreviations List” in the front of the manual.

But if you \\ngo through a period of poor mental health you might find the ways \\nyou’re frequently thinking, feeling or reacting become difficult, or even \\nimpossible, to cope with. This can feel just as bad as a physical illness,  \\nor even worse.\\nWhat is mental wellbeing?\\nMental wellbeing doesn’t have one set meaning. We might use \\nwellbeing to talk about how we feel, how well we’re coping with daily \\nlife or what feels possible right now.\\nGood mental wellbeing doesn’t mean you’re always happy or \\nunaffected by your experiences. But poor mental wellbeing can make \\nit more difficult to cope with daily life.\\nLooking after our mental wellbeing can help us deal with pressure and \\nimprove our ability to cope with life’s ups and downs.\\nWhat are mental health problems?\\nApproximately one in four adults1 and one in six children (5-16 year \\nolds)2 will experience a mental health problem in any given year. \\nCommon mental health problems include depression and anxiety, \\nwhile rarer problems include schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\\nMental health problems can affect the way you think, feel and behave. \\nThey can affect anyone regardless of age, race, religion or income. \\nMental health problems are usually diagnosed by a doctor or mental \\nhealth specialist. Having a diagnosis does not necessarily mean that \\nyou are unwell right now. You could have a diagnosis of a mental health \\nproblem but, at the moment, be able to manage it and function well \\nat work and at home. Equally, you might not have a diagnosis, but still \\nbe finding things very difficult. Everyone’s experience is different and \\ncan change at different times. \\n1 NHS (2007).
